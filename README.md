# CptS 489 livecoding
This repo was originally developed in class on 1-21-2019. We will use branches of it thoughout the semester as starting points for our in-class live coding explorations. I will announce the branch we will use in class prior to each class. Please clone the branch to your local machine prior to class so that you are ready to follow along in class.
